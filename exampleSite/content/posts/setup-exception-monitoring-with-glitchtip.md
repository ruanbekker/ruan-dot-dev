## Exception Monitoring with Gitchtip

This week I decided to have a look at Glitchtip, it's a opensource exception monitoring system, itâ€™s similar to [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/), I published a tutorial on how you can install your own instance of glitchtip on docker and how to integrate a Python Flask application to log errors to glitchtip when exceptions occur.
