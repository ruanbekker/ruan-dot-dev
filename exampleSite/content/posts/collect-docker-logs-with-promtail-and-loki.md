## Collecting Logs with Grafana Promtail

This post shows you how to mount the docker socket to promtail and use promtail's filter feature to only filter containers with specific logs that you want to push to Grafana Loki.

I wrote a tutorial on how you can collect container logs with promtail using docker-compose and send it to grafana loki.
