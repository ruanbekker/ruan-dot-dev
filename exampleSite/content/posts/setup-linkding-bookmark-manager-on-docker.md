## Bookmarks Service with Linkding

This week I stumbled upon [Linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding/blob/master/README.md), which is a self-hosted bookmarks manager service, and what I really like about this project is that it has chrome and firefox browser extensions and a API, and on top of that it's super fast, lightweight and it runs as a container using docker.

I wrote a tutorial on how you can install your own instance of linkding on docker.
